DyVis
=====

The Dynamic Visualizer (short DyVis) is able to visualize the statics and the dynamics of an arbitrary software system by means of information based on static and dynamic analysis. DyVis offers a flexible architecture to easily add support for arbitrary input formats. For now, it accepts KDM representations of software systems representing the statics, and Kieker-based execution traces representing the dynamics.
